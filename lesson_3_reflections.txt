When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When online collaboration and cloud backup are attractive, so almost always :)



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

	The codebase on the remote might be altered by other users, or even me using GitHub online, and if 
	these changes are automatically pulled into my local repo they could affect my code in ways I 
	don't expect.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of 
another?

	Branches extend a codebase in a new direction, for example when developing a new feature. Branches 
	can later be merged back into the codebase they originated from, or into other branches still. 

	Clones are copies of a codebase, branches and all, which can be developed separately from the 
	original code base. Changes to the original codebase can be synced to the clone, and vise versa, if
	 so desired. 

	Forks are clones that are made on GitHub (online) and act the same as offline clone, except that 
	attribution for the original codebase is always given to the original developers/project 
	maintainers.
